## Hi there 👋, I'm Arogya Badal  

A Computer Science student, writing code and breaking (then fixing) things.
I love building stuff—whether it’s AI-powered chatbots, web apps, or chess engines that try to outthink me. 

My current quest? **Building clean, efficient software that (hopefully) doesn’t break five minutes after deployment—because debugging at 2 AM isn’t a personality trait.**
